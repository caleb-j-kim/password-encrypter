This repository contains three C++ files that will be used for verifying passwords and confirming verification.

1. logger.cpp: this program runs in the background as a child process and tracks all commands that are entered and their outputs.
2. encryption.cpp: this program encodes then decodes text (specifically passwords) through a Vigenere Cypher algorithm and is another child process.
3. driver.cpp: this program runs as the 'mainn' file to run the entire project. user inputs are tracked in this file then calls the two child processes to execute their respective functionalities.

Note: The Vigenere cypher only works on letters and is case insensitive. However, this project will only use uppercase letters as test cases.
